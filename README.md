This is a Master by Research 6-month project focusing on the development of a compact, low-cost (less than £400), AI-assisted diagnostic prototype system for white blood cell subpopulation classification. The design of the prototype system was inspired by an open source syringe pump system developed by Pachter group (Booeshaghi et al. 2019). This prototype system improved the overall software control and enhanced the imaging system. Open source electronic boards such as Arduino UNO and Computer Numeric Control (CNC) shield were assembled with stepper motor drivers, DRV8825, to operate the pump.
- The pretrained AI model used was YOLOv4 written by Alexeyab.
- Codes for the Arduino UNO (C++) was modified from Pachter group.
- The syringe pump was assemble using parts already made in the lab (provided by a previous master’s student, Minyeoung Kweon).

The assembly of the prototype system:
